Platireum (TREE) Tokenomics

Introduction
Platireum (TREE) is an innovative stablecoin designed to maintain its value stability by pegging it to a dynamically managed basket of real-world assets, primarily gold. This is achieved through a decentralized autonomous mechanism that automatically adjusts the token's supply based on the real-time market value of its underlying collateral. The goal of TREE is to offer a reliable, decentralized, and stable medium of exchange within the blockchain ecosystem, mitigating the volatility inherent in traditional cryptocurrencies.

Token Name: Platireum
Token Symbol: TREE
Token Standard: ERC-20
Initial Supply: 100,000 TREE tokens (minted to the owner upon deployment)

Core Value Proposition
TREE's stability is derived from its direct computational link to a weighted basket of assets, with gold serving as the primary benchmark. The system continuously evaluates the total value of this asset basket in terms of gold and compares it against the TREE token's market price. Discrepancies between the intrinsic, asset-backed value and the market price trigger automated supply adjustments.

Supply Mechanism: Algorithmic Stability

1.  Asset Valuation:
    * The **AssetManager** contract continuously calculates the total value of the diversified asset basket (e.g., precious metals, other stable assets) in USD, then converts this aggregate value into its equivalent in gold using Chainlink oracles for real-time price feeds.
    * This "asset value in gold" represents the intrinsic, underlying value of the entire Platireum ecosystem.

2.  Price Discovery:
    * The **SupplyController** contract monitors the market price of TREE against USD (ideally from a decentralized exchange, although currently configured for owner-set price updates).
    * The **ValueStabilizer** contract then calculates the "target price per token" by dividing the total asset value in gold by the current total supply of TREE tokens.

3.  Supply Adjustment Mechanism:
    * Deviation Threshold: A **deviation threshold** (e.g., 1%) is set to trigger supply adjustments. If the market price of TREE deviates from its calculated target price beyond this threshold, the adjustment mechanism is activated.
    * Automated Minting (Expansion): If the **market price of TREE is higher than its target asset-backed value**, the system interprets this as an excess in demand or an undervalued token. The **SupplyController** is instructed to **mint new TREE tokens**. These newly minted tokens are typically used to increase liquidity or to be sold into the market, bringing the market price back down towards the target.
    * Automated Burning (Contraction): Conversely, if the **market price of TREE is lower than its target asset-backed value**, the system identifies this as an oversupply or an overvalued token. The **SupplyController** is instructed to **burn existing TREE tokens** (reducing the total supply). This scarcity aims to drive the market price back up towards the target.
    * Maximum Adjustment: A **maximum adjustment limit** (e.g., 10% of total supply per adjustment) is imposed to prevent drastic and potentially destabilizing changes in supply.

4.  Triggering Adjustments:
    * **Manual Trigger**: The contract owner can manually trigger a supply adjustment via the `triggerSupplyAdjustment()` function.
    * **Transaction-Based Trigger (Current Implementation)**: Uniquely, the `_checkPriceAndAdjust()` function is called during every `transfer()` and `transferFrom()` operation. This means that any token transfer can potentially initiate a price check and, if the `priceCheckInterval` has passed and deviation exists, a supply adjustment.

Key Components and Their Roles

* **AssetManager**: Manages the dynamic basket of underlying assets, updates their weights, adds/removes assets, and fetches real-time prices via Chainlink oracles to calculate the total asset value in gold.
* **SupplyController**: Acts as the sole minting and burning authority for TREE tokens. It also serves as the interface for setting/fetching the current market price of TREE.
* **ValueStabilizer**: Contains the core algorithmic logic for maintaining the peg. It compares the market price to the asset-backed value and, if a deviation occurs, commands the SupplyController to mint or burn tokens accordingly.
* **TREE Token (ERC-20)**: The main stablecoin. It integrates the above components and incorporates the transaction-based trigger for supply adjustments.

Future Considerations & Decentralization Pathway

While the current architecture establishes a foundational mechanism for stability, future developments would focus on:

* **Decentralized Price Oracles for Market Price**: Replacing the owner-controlled `updateMarketPrice` in `SupplyController` with a robust, decentralized oracle solution (e.g., TWAP from a major DEX or Chainlink) to truly reflect market dynamics and reduce centralization risk.
* **Decentralized Governance**: Implementing a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) framework to allow TREE token holders to vote on key parameters such as asset weights, deviation thresholds, adjustment limits, and the addition/removal of assets or price feeds.
* **Enhanced Liquidity Incentives**: Developing strategies to incentivize robust liquidity for TREE on decentralized exchanges, ensuring efficient supply adjustments and price discovery.
* **Optimized Adjustment Triggers**: Exploring more efficient and less gas-intensive methods for triggering supply adjustments, such as external keeper networks or time-based automated calls, rather than relying solely on individual token transfers.

Conclusion
Platireum (TREE) aims to be a resilient, asset-backed stablecoin that leverages smart contract automation and oracle technology to maintain a stable value. Its unique supply adjustment mechanism, tied to a diversified asset basket, positions it as a promising candidate for reliable value storage and exchange in the decentralized financial landscape.
